            Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz

          The Taj Mahal is the one sight in India that all travelers need to
          see. The country is filled with incredible cities and fabulous places
          to visit, but the 17th-century Taj Mahal is the one place that says
          you've been to India. This mausoleum, commissioned by the Shah Jahan
          for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, is known internationally as a symbol of
          love.<br />This fantastic structure, made with inlaid precious and
          semi-precious stones, has to be visited to be fully appreciated. Its
          riverfront setting, surrounding gardens, and reflecting pools are also
          what make the Taj Mahal so special.

        <p class="cap">You may have an Indiana Jones feeling as you walk through a 1.2-kilometer-long narrow crack in the sandstone hills and emerge into a hidden city. First built over 2,000 years ago and lost to the outside world for 600 years, the city was only discovered in 1812.

Stunning buildings are carved directly into the red rock walls and are wonderfully preserved, just begging to be explored and photographed.

If you arrive early, an eerie silence, coupled with long shadows, give this abandoned city a special feel.</p>

          Mount Fuji is the most well-known and highest mountain in Japan. Often pictured snowcapped, this dormant volcano is both a spiritual site and one of the top tourist attractions in Japan. Soaring 3,776 meters high, Mount Fuji is one of three Holy Mountains, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.<br /><br />

Hiking to the top of the mountain is a popular thing to do in Japan. Each year, nearly 300,000 people follow one of four routes to the top. One of the most popular things to do is time your hike so that you reach the summit just before sunrise.

Mount Fuji is located 100 kilometers east of Tokyo and is easily accessible via public transit and tours.

Of all the attractions in New York City, this is one every tourist must see. The best thing to do at the Statue of Liberty is to take a ride up to her crown and soak up the view over the city. Access to the statue is via ferry, also a highlight of a visit.</p>

This is a city where history and culture collide and where travelers of all kinds can find the experience they're after.</p>

        <p class="cap">If you are planning to see only one attraction in South America, this is the place to come. The ancient Inca city of Machu Picchu is arguably the most impressive ruined city in the world.<br /><br />

Much of the attraction comes from its location, high in the jungle-clad mountains of Peru. Set on a high plateau with soaring green mountains, the setting is surreal. The sheer tenacity of the original builders to create this amazing place in what would have been impenetrable jungle, is, in itself, impressive.<br /><br />

Visitor numbers are now limited to a maximum per day, so the experience has been greatly enhanced.</p>

Borobudur dates from the 9th century and is one of the largest Buddhist temples in the world. It's a fascinating place to wander about. Over 500 Buddhas are spread around the site, some of which sit under ornate stupas.<br />

Try to visit early in the morning when you'll have the best chance of experiencing a bit of early mist, and the view to the volcanoes will be the clearest.</p>

Tourists were coming to see these magnificent structures literally thousands of years ago.<br /><br />

Located just outside Cairo, the pyramids, which is also where you'll find the Sphinx, are easy to get to, and tours are easy to arrange. A sunset camel ride around the structures is a wonderful experience.</p>

A stroll along the top of the wall provides an incredible view of the structure snaking off into the distance. The wall stretches an astounding 21,196 kilometers, through some remote areas.<br />

Many travelers seeing the sights of China choose to visit the wall on easily organized tours from Beijing, a relatively short motorcoach ride away.</p>
